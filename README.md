# Reservoir Simulation Tutorials using OpenFOAM

Welcome to my repository of reservoir simulation tutorials using OpenFOAM, an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. These tutorials are designed to help users familiarize themselves with the capabilities of OpenFOAM for reservoir simulation and to understand the basic steps involved in setting up and running simulations.

## Tutorials Overview

1. **Basic Reservoir Simulation**: This tutorial introduces users to the fundamental concepts of reservoir simulation using OpenFOAM. It covers topics such as grid generation, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Users will learn how to set up a simple reservoir simulation and interpret the results.

2. **Advanced Reservoir Simulation**: Building on the basic tutorial, this advanced tutorial demonstrates more complex reservoir simulation scenarios. It includes topics such as multi-phase flow, well control, and pressure management. Users will gain a deeper understanding of the simulation process and learn how to adjust simulation parameters to match real-world conditions.

3. **Parallel Reservoir Simulation**: This tutorial focuses on running reservoir simulations in of large scale. It covers topics such as domain decomposition, parallel I/O, and performance tuning. Users will learn how to scale their simulations to larger grids and faster computers, improving simulation efficiency and accuracy.

## Prerequisites

To follow these tutorials, users should have a basic understanding of CFD and reservoir simulation concepts using OpenFOAM. They should also be familiar with OpenFOAM's user interface and scripting language. Additionally, users will need to have OpenFOAM installed on their system and be able to compile and run OpenFOAM applications.
